# Tegonal's github-commons

This repository contains files we are (re-)using in our OSS work published on github.  
Feel free to use them as well, they are licensed under [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).  
You might also be interested in our [oss-template](https://github.com/tegonal/oss-template) which uses them as well next to other files such as our bash [scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts).

# How to use it

In case you start a new open source project, then consider basing your repository on [Tegonal's OSS-template](https://github.com/tegonal/oss-template).
It has already setup github-commons as remote for [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt) and pulled several files. 
If you want to use it in an existing project, then we recommend you [download Tegonal's OSS-template](https://github.com/tegonal/oss-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),
initialise it as described in the readme and then copy the files you want to your existing repsoitory.

If the above does not sound like a plan, then we recommend you fetch the files you need of this repository via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt) into our projects.  
If you want to fetch them with gt as well, then set up a corresponding remote
```bash
gt remote add -r tegonal-gh-commons -u https://github.com/tegonal/github-commons
````

Now you can pull the files you want. For instance, to retrieve the dependabot.yml and put it into the .github directory:
```bash
gt pull -r tegonal-gh-commons -p src/.github/dependabot.yml --chop-path true -d .github
```

# Placeholders

Some files contain placeholders which you should replace.
We provide bash functions which you can source into your pull-hook.sh and use to fill the placeholders.
Get them was well via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt):
```
gt pull -r tegonal-gh-commons -p src/gt/pull-hook-functions.sh
```

However, they require the utility functions of [tegonal-scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts) to be fetched alongside of github-commons.
Thus, if you have not already pulled tegonal-scripts, then [gt pull them](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts#Installation).

And then in your pull-hook.sh you can use it as follows:

<gt-pull-hook-functions>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gt/pull-hook-functions.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
MY_PROJECT_LATEST_VERSION="v1.0.0"

# Assumes tegonal's github-commons was fetched with gt and put into repoRoot/lib/tegonal-gh-commons/src
dir_of_github_commons="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../../../lib/tegonal-gh-commons/src"

if ! [[ -v dir_of_tegonal_scripts ]]; then
	dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$dir_of_github_commons/../../tegonal-scripts/src"
	source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
fi

source "$dir_of_github_commons/gt/pull-hook-functions.sh"

declare _tag=$1 source=$2 _target=$3
shift 3 || die "could not shift by 3"

# replaces placeholders in all files github-commons provides with placeholders
replaceTegonalGhCommonsPlaceholders "$source" "my-project-name" "$MY_PROJECT_LATEST_VERSION" \
	"MyCompanyName, Country"  "code-of-conduct@my-company.com" "my-companies-github-name" "my-project-github-name"
```

## Extend expiration of signing-key

Execute the following script, which will extend the sub-key 945FE615904E5C85 by one year and copies it to 
src/gt/signing-key.public.asc and also signs it again with the key 4B78012139378220 and finally copies the files
to the .gt folder.

```bash
./scripts/extend-expiration-signing-key.sh
```
